Having trouble doing homework? This'll do the trick (Microcontroller not included)

I wanted to create this for personal use and for a Net Devices course that I found interest in. The idea behind the project was to help curb my procrasitnation bug
I am pretty bad at controlling myself when it comes to spacing out my time for assignments

This is a VERY rough work-in-process project so far. I hopefully am planning on doing this with python, HTML5, and whatever else I need. Hopefully I won't abandon the project off of neglegt or p r o c r a s t i n a t i o n.
